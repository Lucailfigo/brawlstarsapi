# BRAWL STARS API

This app uses the Brawl Stars API to fetch data about Brawl Stars players and clubs. The backend is written in express.js and the frontend is written in Svelte. I am working on this project to learn more about Svelte and Brawl Stars API. I plan to add more features in the future. This is helpfull for a quick headstart on your own Brawl Stars API project.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` in the frontend and backend directories
3. Run `npm run dev` in both directories
4. Create a .env file inside the backend directory and add `API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
5. Goto localhost:PORT to view the app
