# BRAWL STARS API

This app uses the Brawl Stars API to fetch data about Brawl Stars players and clubs. It is a work in progress and is not yet complete. The backend is written in express.js and the frontend is written in Svelte. I am working on this project to learn more about Svelte and Brawl Stars API. I plan to add more features in the future. This is helpfull for a quick headstart on your own Brawl Stars API project.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` in the frontend and backend directories
3. Run `npm run dev` in both directories
4. Goto localhost:PORT to view the app
